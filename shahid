num1 = int(input("Enter the first number: "))
num2 = int(input("Enter the second number: "))

# Add the numbers
result = num1 + num2

# Print the result
print("The sum is:", result)

# Check if a number is even
num = int(input("Enter a number to check if it's even: "))
if num % 2 == 0:
    print(num, "is even")
else:
    print(num, "is odd")
Here's a breakdown of what's happening:

The code uses the input() function to get two numbers from the user.
The int() function is used to convert the user input into integers.
The + operator is used to add the two numbers together and store the result in the result variable.
The print() function is used to print the result.
The code then uses an if statement to check if a number is even. The % operator is used to find the remainder of the number divided by 2. If the remainder is 0, the number is even, otherwise it's odd.
You can run this code and enter different numbers to see how it works!

Note: This code assumes that the user will enter valid integers. If you want to handle invalid input (e.g. non-integer values), you can use try-except blocks and error handling techniques.
